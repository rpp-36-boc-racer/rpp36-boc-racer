## Introduction

This is a month long project where our team completed an MVP full stack application for an external user.

- Each week is a sprint.
- First sprint is planning, design and code skeleton, CI/CD set up.
- Second and third week is Agile developement
- Last week is app polish including bug fixes and UI finalization
- Personal goals as following:
  - Ai Lam: Message List
  - Amrinder Singh: Friends list and work on chat feature
  - Danting Huang: Instant messaging
  - Noelle Tian: Add Friends
  - Paul Watson: Architecture owner. Authentication feature
  - Ziqian Li: Product manager. Build routing and picture upload, image expiration features.

## What does the app do

> A mobile first instant chat with friends to share funny moments of their pets. Upload or take a snap a photo to share. Photo will expire after 10 minutes of opening the message. System will notify sender when photo is saved by friends. User requires log in to use the app for security and privacy. Search and add friends to start a conversation.

## Install

```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

## Technical Challenges and research you anticipated

### instant messaging

> Without refreshing page to send instant messages between 2 users. Research on socket.io.

### Consistent Styling

> Quick and effectively style the app as a mobile-friendly web app. Research on Material UI.

## Challenges that were unexpected

## Video Demo

## How does the app work?

> - What happens behind the scenes when the user interacts with it?
> - OR What are all the places the data travels? What happens to that data?
> - Optionally include a diagram
> - How does the tech stack come together?
