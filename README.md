## Introduction

This is a month long project where our team completed an MVP full stack application for an external user.

- Each week is a sprint.
- First sprint is planning, design and code skeleton, CI/CD set up.
- Second and third week is Agile developement
- Last week is app polish including bug fixes and UI finalization
- Personal goals as following:
  - Ai Lam: Message List
  - Amrinder Singh: Friends list and work on chat feature
  - Danting Huang: Instant messaging
  - Noelle Tian: Add Friends
  - Paul Watson: Architecture owner. Authentication feature
  - Ziqian Li: Product manager. Build routing and picture upload, image expiration features.

## What does the app do

> A mobile first instant chat app that you can safely share awkward pet photos with friends. Upload or take a snap to share. Photo will expire after 10 minutes of reading. Got a friend who saved the awkward photo? Don't worry, the system will notify you when that happens both in the app and through email. To start using the app, sign up with a valid email address. To start a chat, search and add friends from the friend page and start the conversation!
